# Host bridge connected domain examples

kvm_domains:
  # Virtual machine connected to network which points to a host defined bridge (configured outside libvirt).
  # When the VM boots the interface will be changed dynamically to a 'bridge' type interface.
  # This will cause Cockpit to show the warning: 'Pending changes, restart VM', which will not be solved after a restart.
  # Apart from this, this configuration works fine.
  # Bug: https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-machines/issues/563
